## Project Description and Objectives 
The purpose of this study is to predict whether a Costa Rican household is suffering
from poverty in order to correctly allocate funds to support struggling families. For this study it
was hypothesized that at least one of the four classification techniques of the Random Forest
Decision Trees, CART Decision Tree, C5.0 Decision Tree, or K-Nearest Neighbor being
utilized will result in a model that predicts an individual’s poverty status index based on
demographic characteristics. More specifically, a secondary hypothesis is that the best predictor
will be the Random Forest Decision Tree, based on sensitivity being greater than eighty percent.
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The predictor variables observed in this study include:
access to cooking gas, access to trash truck facilities, number of dependents, access to sewage
system, and total number of individuals living in a household. The study determined that the
best model was the Random Forest model, which had a sensitivity value of 0.742 and an
accuracy value of 0.739. Further research regarding the accuracy and sensitivity of the model
could be evaluated using additional predictor variables such as education level of individuals
within a given household or location of household.
## Machine Learning Goals 
* whether a Costa Rican household is suffering from poverty
## Business Goals 
*  Help alleviate financial stress for Costa Rican households by determining how to correctly allocate funds to support struggling families
* Employ predictive model within 7 weeks from start date (February 28th, 2022 - April 18th, 2022)
